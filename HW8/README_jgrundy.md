This is your original plot:

My feedback:
Looks great, the quadratic model seems ot fit Brooklyn very well but Manhattan is less convincing - 
maybe this is part of your story which could be interesting. A few suggestions:

1. Add thousand separators in axis labels to make more readable
2. In legend, include point and line markers for both Manhattan and BK (right now, you have just line)
3. Remove checkered background
4. Remove gray background as it doesn't add much to the plot
