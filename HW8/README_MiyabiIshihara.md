This is your original plot:

![Plot](https://github.com/MiyabiIshihara/PUI2015_mishihara/blob/master/HW8/HW8.ipynb)

My feedback:
Visually appealing plot. Good color selection and labelling (axes and title are readable!)
A few suggestions/comments:

1. Remove comma in title for Month Year
2. Why are the dots different sizes? Is there a 3rd dimension that is not mentionned? If so, label. If not, remove and make all dots same size.
3. You may want to project this map from lat/long to NY State Plane - Long Island (NAD83)
4. Add a basemap, and you will no longer need the grids and axes/axis labels
5. Maybe mention Citbike somewhere in the title so we know what you are plotting
