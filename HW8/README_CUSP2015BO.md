This is your original plot:

My feedback:
Cool boxplot! You can export image by adding to your code: savefig(imagename.png). Some suggestions related to the plot itself:

1. Add title
2. Rather than having a legend for the boro codes, just have the boro name directly below its plot
3. Add thousand separators for y-axis labels to make numbers more readable
4. Remove gray background as it doesn't add much to the plot
5. Increase size of y-axis title, also, what are the units?
6. What are the red dots? Mean? Can you make this more clear
7. Limit to one or two colors only since the color distinctions are not important to the plot
